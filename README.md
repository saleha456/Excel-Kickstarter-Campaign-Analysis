# Excel Kickstarter Campaign Analysis

## Conclusions
The purpose of this analysis was to look at a dataset of 4000 projects for Kickstarter campaigns and determine any market trends.  From this dataset, we can conclude the following:
•	Campaigns under categories such as Theater, Music, and Film/video were more successful.  Of these categories, Theater had the highest number of successful campaigns.  
•	Theater campaigns that started in May were more successful than any other month out of year. 
•	Campaigns that started in December were less successful overall.
•	The higher the goal, the less likely a campaign was to reach its goal and was more likely to fail or get cancelled. Campaigns that had a goal category of 5000 or less had a higher success rate in reaching their goal.

## Limitations
There are some limitations with this dataset.  The date range of this data is from 2009 to 2017 so we will not be able to identify any trends from the past couple of years.  The data has a very high standard deviation and is skewed to the right.  In addition, there might be some sample or cultural bias.  Even though, this data includes projects from a variety of countries, the number of Kickstarter campaigns from United States, Great Britain, and Canada were significantly higher than other countries.  The cultural bias of these countries will be higher when it comes to this data.
